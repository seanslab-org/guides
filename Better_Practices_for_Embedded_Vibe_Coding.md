Better Practices for Embedded Vibe Coding

The purpose of this doc is to collect better practices (I knew they are not the best, yet) for embedded vibe coding.

# Overrall
1. Prepare more than one agents and models, for backup/review/contingency
2. LLM can "cheat", don't "trust" them until you verify the result
3. Always keep in mind that it works does not mean it works after hot reset or cold reboot

# Specification

# Design
1. Break big tasks to small ones, and continue doing this until unnecessary 

# Coding

# Test

# Debug
1. After several rounds of similar error pattern, stop (clean context or even re-start)

# Mindset
1. Have faith, as long as you believe it can be done, it can be done
2. Use your instinct, embedded system requires tangible experiences


# Misc.
